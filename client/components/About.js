   <h1 className="greeting"> QuickI18n is an improvement upon existing internationalization and accessibility methodologies like for the web. LocaleString(), Format.js and React INTL,  These methodologies provide a wealth of features including React components and even an API used to format dates, numbers, and strings according to the window.navigator.language object. They can even pluralize text and handle translated versions of that text. What they don't do is translate that text in real time. We decided to put two and two together and with the Google Translate API populate the LocaleString object with a rough translation where there previously was none. </h1>
